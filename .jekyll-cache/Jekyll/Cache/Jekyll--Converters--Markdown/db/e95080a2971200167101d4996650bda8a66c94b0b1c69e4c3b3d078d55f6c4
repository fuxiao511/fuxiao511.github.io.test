<p>Given the above requirements, we have embarked on the following roadmap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add cgroup v2 support to libcgroup. Libcgroup was started in 2008 during the early days of cgroup v1 but has largely languished over the last few years. As maintainers of <a href="https://github.com/libcgroup">libcgroup</a>, Oracleâ€™s Dhaval Giani and I are defining, guiding, and implementing the libraryâ€™s transition to full cgroup v2 support. In 2019, we restarted development on libcgroup and have since added <a href="https://travis-ci.org/libcgroup/libcgroup">automated unit tests</a>, <a href="https://github.com/libcgroup/libcgroup-tests/tree/master/ftests">automated functional tests</a>, and <a href="https://coveralls.io/github/libcgroup/libcgroup?branch=master">code coverage</a>. We recently added an <a href="https://github.com/libcgroup/libcgroup/commit/ae76f3a8c9c90ac05feb046714f4f6566b24cd3c">â€œignoreâ€ feature</a> to cgrules for an internal customer, and currently have a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/libcg/mailman/message/37007410/">patchset</a> out for review to add cgroup v2 support to cgget and cgset.</li>
  <li>Create an abstraction layer that can receive cgroup v1 (or v2) requests and translate them to the correct underlying system settings - be it v1 or v2. This layer should allow cgroup v1 users to continue to specify v1 settings even if the application is running on a v2 system, thus minimizing changes to the application.</li>
  <li>And finally create a usability layer to further remove the user from the intricacies and pitfalls of cgroup management. Not all users are cgroup experts and not all users want to be cgroup experts. A usability layer would give these users the ability to consistently and safely configure their systems every single time.</li>
</ul>
